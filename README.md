CORONA GEOLOCATION TRACKER
This project is used to map the addresses of the home quarantined people into geolocations i.e. in terms of latitude and longitude and finally
map it on a open source or google map api.

The python program is used to convert the addresses into geolocations in terms of lat and long. 
Then the html file serves as an output to visualize all the locations.
